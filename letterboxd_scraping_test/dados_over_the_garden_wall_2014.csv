7,kate,5,i wish i could erase this from my mind so i could watch it all over again for the first time
8,demi adejuyigbe,5,"I always forget that Greg is the absolute platonic ideal of a character to me. Just perfect in every way. Can’t think of a show that wouldn’t be approved with his addition!   “You can hold my hand Jason Funderberker, I don’t care.”"
9,Karst,5,I want the opossum with the human-like shoulders in episode 3. He’s so good at guitar. Give him a spinoff already!!! Cmon!!
10,ele 🪷,4,wirt just wanted to give his girl a mixtape of his poetry and him playing the clarinet and I want him to know that I support him
11,˗ˏˋ suspirliam ˊˎ˗,4,can we get more dark and spooky yet emotional and beautiful animated masterpieces like this please !!!
12,James (Schaffrillas),3.5,"Reminds me of Infinity Train Season 1! You know, the nice, charming, good one that paved the way for the masterpieces that were Seasons 2 and 3  Though to be fair Infinity Train doesn't have Greg"
13,feat. dante from the dmc series,5,"here, eat your dirt."
14,Karst,5,CHILLS when the highway man shows up
15,SilentDawn,4.5,"83  For the autumn leaves and the candle-light, for the crescent moon and the creatures roaming storied paths in which they find solace; a new world is granted for two young boys, discovering that reality is merely a journey from one grove to another. As touching as it is expressive, this miniseries is carried by the wind towards the chill of a slowly setting sun; an experience lifted by levity and pummeled by adolescent awkwardness. At once a poisoned treat for the onset of Fall and a reminder of its clammy, eternal embrace. Such a cozy, wonderful thing."
16,kj,5,why read dante’s inferno when you can watch this instead
17,amaya,5,i mean it's fine! it's ok. it's not like i've heard the soundtrack more times than my father's voice. i definitively enjoy this a normal amount
18,Sally Jane Black,Unrated," A lot has been written about the depth and beauty of the animation here, so I won't belabor it. I don't have the technical knowledge to add to that discussion, anyway. I will say that I enjoyed it, especially the tone it set with its color palette and the throwback feeling of certain parts (the cloud city part especially seemed to harken back (thanks, nabbers)). The other technical aspects of this were generally fairly impressive as well--the music was delightful…"

24,demi adejuyigbe,4,honestly i was tired and in a post-IT fugue when i watched this so i dozed off for a lil bit but this is so sweet and funny and lovely and i’m actually excited to watch it again
25,CinemaJoe,4.5,A good example of an experience that’s enhanced tenfold when it’s watched surrounded by friends.  Someone play two old cats with me now.

27,aleph beth null,4.5,"eighth or maybe ninth rewatch and i'm still discovering new little connections and kindnesses in this relentlessly melancholy (kierkegaardian?) work of love. bodies and the material world are affirmed all over the place:  — auntie whispers and adelaide are never ever mocked for their frames or non-passing voices — bells stubbornly remain stuck inside frogs even outside the unknown — resurrected pottsfielders require glorified/pumpkinified bodies (reclaiming the satires of seneca jr, zomg) — 'no, no, not a wish, i'm not…"
28,Laura,Unrated,"would actually die for a mixtape of poetry & clarinet playing, sara is a lucky gal"
29,Drew Clark,5,This show had a strange familiarity about it. Like I’d seen it all before in a forgotten dream from when I was younger.
30,nathaxnne [hiatus <3],5,"To find oneself in a dark wood, not in the middle of life, but somewhere closer to its start, would indeed be maybe better, a pilgrim without progress, where you were is where you were all along and you were there and you were there and you were there from the fall on into the winter and the waiting until spring. The stories that aren't true might be true anyway or at least illuminatory, as something to burn that gives…"

32,adambolt,3.5,if i ever get lost in the forest i want Greg with me at all times
33,Fam Squad Yeet,5,"Over the Garden Wall is on of those rare shows that are masterfully crafted. Like Adventure Time it perfectly captures that sense of Child-like whimsicality for adventure and the underlying evils of the world. The show is dark and moody with it’s perfect animation, brown color palette, and mysterious score. Yet it’s so light with its message and star-eyed Gregory’s knack for looking at the best side of everything."
34,celia,4,it’s just a wholesome lil show about 2 brothers in purgatory and i like it very much
35,feat. dante from the dmc series,5,oh my god???
36,reibureibu,4.5,"Takes me back to a place in my life where the world was simpler and I was happier. Both of which, to be fair, were mostly due ignorance, but I can't say I don't miss it.  The falls at my campus were some of the most beautiful I've ever seen. There's something real special about the golden-brown myriad of leaves pigmenting the streets, the gentle nippy drafts which coax out the coat-layering expert in us all, the encroaching time of…"
37,cookie,5,always leaves me wishing i had a little half brother 🍂
38,Caleb Johnson,5,"This was a weird experience. Not due to the content of this, but due to the circumstances in which I started to watch this. I was asleep for the night, but then had one of those nights where I kinda just randomly woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't get back to sleep. So you better believe your boy popped on the TV to watch something. I don't know what made me think of it, but I suddenly remembered I…"

43,🌻 lindsay 🌻,5,ain’t that just the way
44,jeaba,5,the best movie to watch at the beginning of september. happy over the garden wall season everyone!!
45,Sam Thompson,Unrated,"I wish Greg was my son. But ONLY if he stays this age forever.  A clear sign that a show is an all timer for me is that when I finish it, I simultaneously feel sad and satisfied. Satisfied because it is complete but sad because the journey is over and I can't see more of the characters I have fallen in love with.  Ain't that just the way..."
46,Jessica Wessica,3.5,"Greg the Egg was my favorite character  ""We're here to burgle your turts"""
47,Tay,Unrated,"if we all have burdens to bear,  Over the Garden Wall  suggests that our trials and tribulations may not have to be borne alone, nor does a descent down into darkness have to be devoid of light.  Nate Cash's reimagining of a forested Inferno is strange and magical, comedic and melancholic. there are such sinister implications and undertones to  OtGW,  but it never relents to its own pain. Wort and Greg and their cohort of companions are charming, stubborn, and…"

53,Wesley R. Ball,4.5,"I was unaware that Cartoon Network shows can also be cinema.  I've been in some kind of slump out of watching movies lately and I've gotten myself lost in the worlds of Adventure Time and Regular Show. I'm kind of trying to get some changes made in my current life situation that created some strange addiction to watching Adventure Time nearly nonstop, like it actually takes me to some safe, happy place that reminds me of a simpler time in…"
54,"Rafael ""Parker!!"" Jovine",4.5,"Ok, so long story short.... as I grow up and enter my teenage years, my mom did everything in her powers to actually have me hate cartoons (mostly because I spent talking like a kid), which sorta worked (I say sorta because I kept watching live action TV til very long into my twenties). So of course, its been FOREVER since I watched Cartoon Network as a whole, therefore you can imagine the abundant level of nostalgia that logo with…"
55,Alice Stoehr,3.5,"This musical fantasy evokes a range of influences—The Wizard of Oz, Spirited Away, Edward Gorey, the Fleischer Bros.—while sustaining a glissando across a whole spectrum of emotions, from goofy to wistful to heartbroken and back again. It's a world of its own, sparkling new but faintly familiar. (Here's Christopher Lloyd, and there's Tim Curry: the cartoon antagonists of decades past.) Jokes and myths, which I suspect may be interchangeable, accumulate into a compact edifice that you can ascend and gaze down from, at which point you may as well clamber back down and watch all ten episodes again."
56,Felipe,5.0,I love everything about this. You like fall? You like frogs? frogs in old timey suits? Pumpkins? Watch this. It's a halloween must-see.
57,jeaba,5.0,the perfect watch for a rainy day. so cozy!!
58,Mario 🟠🟢🔵,4.5,"Wasn't planning on rewatching this until autumn, but I had a shitty day and needed a comfort watch. Animated Movies Ranked 9/10  Edit: 4000th review 🥳🥳"
59,Leighton Trent,4.5,"As precious and as magical as anything Cartoon Network has produced.   Nothing else puts me in the spirit of Halloween, and Autumn in general, like this does 🎃 🍂       💀 All the Spooks 2021 💀"
60,maiapog,5,"""It's even growing inside him!"" ""No, I was just eating leaves.""  Re-watched this morning while sipping on a pumpkin latte... IT'S FALL BABY! A perfect show. I love Greg with my whole heart. Peak example that being silly is of the utmost importance. Animation again being the best medium ever!!!!"
61,Sally Darr,4.5,all of this because Wirt wanted to give a girl a mixtape of him reading poetry and playing clarinet playing he’s a keeper and Greg can burgle my turts with doctor cucumber any day
62,brynn helena,5,"this is regular show but for queer, dark academia kids"
63,🌻 lindsay 🌻,5,"My love for this show comes from the same part of me that feels a swell of happiness when I feel the crisp air of fall.   Summer has never been a time of the year where I feel relaxed. It’s actually always been the most stressful times of the year for me. When I was younger, it was a break in my routine that went on for too long. When I have nothing that I have to do, I just…"
64,{Todd},4.5,"""That's vague, what does that mean?"" - Wirt,   Beatrice the annoyed Blue Bird is LITERALLY my spirit animal... you hear that, LITERALLY?   Show this to your kids! They deserve to have this treasure as part of their memories of when they began to get fucked up. The creator of Adventure Time, one of my favorite shows, decided to do something more long-form and a bit more grounded and scary and it is fantastic. Two young child brothers, Wirt and Greg,…"

67,Justin Decloux,5,"The perfect Fall Watch.   It's got dancing pumpkin skeletons, an amazing rock fact-centric sense of humour, and creepy concepts strained through 30s Fleischer cartoon imagery. Does this feature the last example of John Cleese giving a hilarious performance?   I know it's got a cult following, but I can only imagine how packed the shelves of Hot Topic would be with GARDEN WALL: merch if this had been released as a theatrical film.   And so the story is complete and everyone is satisfied with the ending. And so on and so forth..."
68,claira curtis,5,"“Where… are we?”  “In the woods.”  “I mean… what are we doing out here?”  “We’re walking home!”   Where a forest is not just a forest, a walk home is not just a simple home, an ask for help can bode more harm than aid, a lantern may cast a larger shadow rather than shine a light in the dark, and where the thing that matters most in this world, and the next, is your brother.   It’s time for fall. It’s time for the yearly Over the Garden Wall rewatch. It’s time to come home."
69,Wade,Unrated,Instant Masterpiece
70,Lee ॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ,5,"If dreams can't come true, then why not pretend?  Both a campfire horror about grief and the terror of the passing of time, and a whimsical fairy tale about responsibility and self determination. Note how many scenes involve a character telling a story. Cant help but well up over the Woodsman."

Watching it with a pretty lady -- the first lady you've ever dated -- and she holds your hand the whole time and laughs at all the same things you laugh at and she orders Mexican food and gives you wine and it's the best thing that's happened for you in this haze of alert levels and lockdowns and Unknown.

78,Jesusmary,5.0,"Warning: Spoiler(s) ahead!   Man, I've never expected that I'd be bawling my eyes out over a cutesy CalArts-drawn animation. I know ominous twists were lying low out there but I genuinely did not see the last two episodes bushwhacking the heck out of my emotions coming. It was as though they were just biding their time hidden amongst the overcast amber of squash and autumn leaves, lulling me with a false sense of ease and assurance that the series will…"
79,kat🕷,5.0,"""Over the Garden Wall"" may initially seem like a show for kids, but this mix of autumnal melancholy, surreal humor and American folklore (turkeys, pumpkins, village schools, etc.) it‘s not only far too dark in some places for younger kids, it‘s also contains numerous references, allusions to mythology and scope for interpretation, which will probably only be accessible to adults. In addition, the series has also very beautifully drawn visuals and old background music."
80,Cinema Strikes Back 🟣,4.0,"Das ist wirklich eine DER schönsten animierten Serien da draußen! Gruselig und herbstlich, dabei wirklich witzig und originell. Mein Halloweenkostüm stehts auf jeden Fall 🐘 🎃!"

86,🌻 lindsay 🌻,5,"I love this show so much!! Rewatching it always makes me crave fall. I want chilly weather and sweaters and a hot coffee right now.   It’s just such a great little fantasy for kids and adults. It’s spooky but not scary. It’s deep but still full of humor. The dynamic between the siblings is so real - there’s so much annoyance but also love and fun and protectiveness.   The animation is gorgeous, the music is catchy and cute. It all…"

94,Kyler,5,I really miss these type of shows that Cartoon Network used to make.
95,Victor Jugo,5,"Cada capítulo es como una fábula o uno de esos cuentos que uno solía escuchar cuando era pequeño. En serio me gustó mucho esta serie, sus personajes, las canciones, los lugares, las situaciones, todo tiene un montón de carisma y magia. Además de una ambientación increíble, que tan solo con la música nos da esa sensación de ser algo mágico. 2 hermanos perdidos en un bosque encantado donde se encontrarán desde aves que hablan, ranas que actúan como humanos, una escuela para animales, y hasta la temida bestia del bosque."

99,jeaba,5,this isn't my second time watching this show over the last three days. mind your own business.
100,Matthew LeCHARLTON,3,A novel approach to telling traditional fairy tales with a contemporary quirkiness. A little funny and dark around it’s margins but essentially childish.  Its impressive list of voice actors aren’t enough to cover the cracks of weak writing and a repetitious villain of the week that adds little purpose.

The world around them is equal parts intriguing and horrifying.

110,Fred 🇵🇷,3.5,"Cozy, casually grim, and wonderfully realized, there is a lot to like about the adventures of Over the Garden Wall. The character and locale designs in this are reason enough to check it out. Story-wise, for the most part, this worked for me despite not packing the kind of punch that similar Cartoon Network fantasy fare has pulled off (Adventure Time comes to mind). Only in the borderline obnoxiously cutesy and oddly elementary school-appropriate singalongs, of which there are about…"
111,Big Rig,4.5,"Despite its wild creativity and fantastical elements, Over the Garden Wall is eerily familiar and surprisingly grounded. This series is very alike Studio Ghibli films in the sense that it understands that there is a certain magic that exists in the world; it may not be the mystical creatures pictured in this show, but the artistry (yes, this series is, first and foremost, a piece of art) and storytelling that suspends our disbelief, and invites us into a world that makes…"

113,Daddy0,5,"It's a good habit to take the time once every fall for a pilgrimage into the autumnal looking glass wood of fables and rustic Americana distorted, Over the Garden Wall. Brother Wirt lives by impotence and anxiety, brother Greg lives by the strength of the absurd, and both have got to bear witness to those truths which the Unknown offers in order to make anything worthwhile of the Known. Well, existentialists will settle for their “loveliest lies” over truth, but…"
114,The Armchair Critic,5,"🎬 • 🍿 • 📀 • 🎞️ • 🎥   A piece that soared well, well over my expectations! Not only in quality, but also my understanding of what it was that I was actually about to watch. ‘Over The Garden Wall’ is a film (kind of) that is genius crafted-humour and storytelling at its absolute finest. The plot, whimsical and fluid, still fulfilling this perfect little story arc, trollops along to the humming to sound of Greg’s latest tune, a…"

116,Danny,5,That feeling when you finally watch something for the first time and instantly you know you are adding this to your yearly fall required viewings. What a delight.
117,Movies “Mofa” Fan123,Unrated,Very cute miniseries! I enjoyed it for sure. Very nice vibes and I liked the darker horror aspects to it. Definitely one of the better Cartoon Network shows though they definitely have had some bangers throughout the years (Regular Show supremacy). The voice acting and characters were great. I liked the odd characters they met during the journeys. It mixes a lot of great genres. I don’t think I loved it as much as the rest of Letterboxd but it is a great series for sure!  And that’s a Rock Fact🪨
118,han🐈,5,Me being sick gave me the perfect excuse to rewatch this for the 5th time!! I love this more every time I watch it!!!

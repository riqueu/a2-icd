0,Delfi Nugget,5.0,"10/10 one of the best animations ive watched. It is creepy as hell yet remains whimsical, it has a very profound underlying meaning to everything, and ELIJAH WOOD!"
1,Quintubble,5.0,"Greg is me.  I am Greg. We are one in the same.   Patrick McHale’s “Over The Garden Wall”  is so damn perfect. I really enjoyed this type of storytelling from Cartoon Network and wished they did more miniseries. I loved all the songs so much and have been listening to “potatoes and molasses”  on repeat. It’s really emotionally well done in the end and leaves you feeling so satisfied.  fun facts: All of the names that Gregory gave his lucky frog: Kitty, Wirt, Jr., George Washington, Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin, Dr. Cucumber, Greg Jr., Ronald, Skipper, Jason Funderberker."

Bien que la qualité de Cartoon Network ne soit plus à prouver (Gumball, Adventure Time, etc...) il nous a livrer en 2015 cette pépite passée presque inaperçu.

I dont know a single person who also saw this growing up, except for myself.  Revisiting this show 10 years after I first saw it, I had many expectations.

75,ddelaneyy,5.0,"I love this miniseries ♥️  It’s beautiful in meaning, animation, and storytelling.   It has very storybook vibes and it’s genuinely enjoying for people of any age.

93,smil.os,5.0,beatrice eu te vejo como uma figura materna....
94,Kevin K,5.0,"I kept getting this recommended to me and it's reputation preceded it but I thought it was gonna be too mid-2000's adult swim style ""lulz so random"" type cartoon. While there is a bit of that I think it works really well because the storytelling and world building are so rich and stuffed full of symbolism that it feels at once childlike and mature. The foreshadowing, easter eggs and tiny secrets in the margins reward rewatches. The voice acting is perfectly cast and the music is so incredible I often listen to the soundtrack during the fall. Top 5 all time greatest American animated 'films'."

111,ValValVal_23,5.0,A favorite of mine with stunning music animation and story. I make sure to watch this show every year around the fall/halloween season.

118,sarah 😌✨ she/her,4.5,the pacing of this is fantastic and the script is so incredible. such beautiful animation too!
119,Liam,4.5,Episode 1: 8/10 that dog was nightmare fuel.   Episode 2: 8/10 I thought that dog was night mare fuel. That pumpkin giant was terrifying.  Episode 3: 9/10 banger comedy and an actual banger in “potatoes and molasses”.   Episode 4: 8/10 first look at the beast and it did not disappoint. Definitely giving adventure time and gravity falls vibes but more eerie tbh.   Episode 5: 6/10 the comedy wasn’t hitting the same and the vibe wasn’t like the last 4 episodes. …

191,Léo Souza,4.0,"Com o seu criador, o Patick McHale, vindo da boa leva de animadores que participaram de Flapjack e que vieram a participar de um dos melhores momentos das animações para TV americana que foi a década de 2010, Over The Garden Wall surge como uma espécie de Alice no País das Maravilhas, bem contemporâneo, mas que tem suas maiores valências o equilibro perfeito entre terror e a inventividade fantástica que esse tipo de show costuma ter e o uso quase…"
192,laurlaurland,5,i will be rewatching this show every fall for the rest of my life.

197,Hunter Lucena,5,é só perfeito. somente perfeito.
198,islandwalks,4.5,"This is one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Great story line, amazing voice acting and plenty creepy while also being endearing. The only thing that would make it better is if we got more of it to watch!   Also, I’m torn between Mr. President and Benjamin Franklin as the best frog names."
199,Raskol28,5,absolute perfect.
200,Cams 😵‍💫,5,Va a mi lista de series de las cuales borrarla mi memoria para volver a   Verla
201,Luke,4.5,There’s gotta be some scientific correlation between being named Wirt and having male pattern baldness at 15
202,Brandy,5,"Best short animated show hands down. Hate to say it but this show is even better then gravity falls just slightly though, gravity falls is an amazing show. Highly highly recommend watching only in fall though it’s just Halloween vibes"
203,Japare,3.5,Does Wirt wear wigs? All I know is Greg's on crack. And thats a rock fact!
204,Yass,4.5,"Me senti imersa do início ao fim, tudo cria uma ambientação eficiente pra que você se sinta engolido pelo que há de subentendido nessa obra, as sensações, medos, questionamentos, tudo o que não é claro, mas você sente lá no fundo."
205,rgleas,4.5,Greg the turt bugler is my favorite character in cinematic history I think
206,moatz,5,It's so sad how cn killed such great series like this
207,nick schneider,5,"about as good as it gets for animation - funny, heartfelt, imaginative, etc.   i could go on raving about it, but it’d probably take as long for me to write everything i liked about it as it would take for you to watch the first two chapters, and by then you’d be hooked."
208,Joseph4268,5,So good
209,GoodWitchMaria,5,SWEET POTATOOESSSS AND MOLASSES!!
210,Jono,4.5,"I haven’t recorded a series on here before simply cause I hate how letterboxd doesn’t have a different section for them BUT Over the Garden Wall is essentially like a stitched together film so I’m counting it hehehehe  An amazingly charming animated mini series with witty yet endearing writing. The animation also lends itself to those descriptions, but I feel as though I need to give this studio their flowers for how distinct the aesthetic choices of said animation are.…"
211,𝐅,Unrated,"A qualche mese dalla maturità, dovevo scegliere l'argomento di tesi. Le opere che avevo analizzato erano: Evangelion, The Tatami Galaxy, Over the Garden Wall, Watchmen. Dicevano che potevo portarne solo una.  Alla fine scelsi Evangelion perché mi permetteva di esporre molti più interessi - studi di sociologia nel giappone post-guerra, bioetica, postmodernismo, loop quantum gravity, nietzsche, freud/jung, calcolo probabilistico, concezione alchemica dei numeri, simbolismo negli scacchi, joycean paralysis, the wasteland, breakdown di navi da guerra in wwii, ecc.  Per anni…"

220,tezu_jacquelin,5.0,"No sé lo que acabo de ver, pero lo que vi, ¡¡¡fue hermoso!!! La animación te transmite tanta rareza, nostalgia, elegancia e incluso te trata con delicadeza. Las referencias a la Divina Comedia de Dante no se hacen esperar, es interesante el mensaje oculto que hay en cada episodio. Sin duda, una de las mejores mini series que he visto."

237,cali,4.5,"scavenger hunt #111, june '24  1. Thank you to Henry for being last month's host. Why don't we start by watching a film Henry rated 5 stars.  a surprising but flawless amalgamation of the eerie and the tender. each episode was a morsel of whimsy, little bites of wonder that took me back to a time when all tales were a revelation to me, pathways into the unknown."

249,UltraCr1t1cal,4.0,"An oddity for sure, creepy in many instances, and charming in it's own right."
250,Benjamin Kaspar,4.0,"Something lurks in the dark, and it clings to a lantern. Life and light lie under the watchful eye of death and darkness. Evil as caretaker of the simple and innocent, and the simple and innocent as the accomplices of evil.   Again and again, Over the Garden Wall positions childhood as a back and forth between childish things and a return to a darker nature. From little girls with cannibalistic curses, to children reduced to being a light in the…"

259,Lemon_Gab,5.0,"Pocas cosas se equiparan al Paquete Completo de amor y pasión que nos ofrecen quienes crearon esta masterpiece. Su música, sus actuaciones de voz, colores, historia y expresión nos abrazan durante toda la serie, que nos va a dejar redondos y satisfechos sabiendo que vimos algo Hermoso."
260,rojita_1221,5.0,estoy muy feliz
261,Fawkins,5.0,Good show! Had evaded this for a while but it being a miniseries made it pretty easy to binge. I have trouble consuming longer-term series. My favorite chapter was the one that showed why they went over the wall in the first place. I’ll have to give that a rewatch at some point

277,Maria,5.0,A única parte ruim sobre esse desenho é que ele acaba
278,Lucaryo306,5.0,"Over the garden walls (Más allá del jardín) es una serie de dibujo animados que en mi parecer, puede resultar de lo más extraña, pero en realidad es una metáfora a las actitudes, situaciones y sentimientos de cada persona a lo largo de su vida.   Cada personaje cuenta (y parte de) una historia diferente, historias que se pueden ver reflejadas en nuestro día a día. En cuanto a los sentimientos y actitudes, los podemos observar en la forma de actuar…"

293,obikanwenobi,5.0,La obra maestra de Cartoon Network. No puedo creer como no la había visto antes. Mirenla.   IT'S CAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS NUDE!
294,WITEEYEZ,5.0,“It’s your fault Greg!” Over the Garden wall is a story about to brothers lost in the woods. It takes aspects from old fairy tales and cartoons. Each episode is heartwarming and leaves you with a smile on your face. The storytelling is genius and the animation is covered in Easter eggs and hints at what is to come. The show focus’s on the relationship between the 2 brothers and how they build a stronger bond by the end. This is a cartoon that takes itself seriously and has one of the greatest endings ever. I would recommend this to anyone.
295,inés,5.0,will def rewatch during halloween
296,☆lizzie☆,4.5,this was the most lovely most fall most sweet thing i’ve ever seen
297,Ryans_Planets,5.0,"Two brothers almost die to a monster who snuck it's way from adult horror into a kids cartoon.  Over the garden wall is a creation that only comes once a century, it's truly just a wonderful piece of art. From the symbolism of limbo, where the boys are stuck after almost drowning, to how the monster is defeated. The beast is truly one of my favourite monsters ever, it has stuck with me since i watched it for the first time, even though we only see its true form once, and only for a second. Over the Garden Wall is much more than a kids show."
298,Bex Alimj,5.0,pure comfort vibe

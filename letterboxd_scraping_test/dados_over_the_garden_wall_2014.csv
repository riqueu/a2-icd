7,kate,,5.0,i wish i could erase this from my mind so i could watch it all over again for the first time
8,demi adejuyigbe,,5.0,"I always forget that Greg is the absolute platonic ideal of a character to me. Just perfect in every way. Can’t think of a show that wouldn’t be approved with his addition!   “You can hold my hand Jason Funderberker, I don’t care.”"
9,Karst,,5.0,I want the opossum with the human-like shoulders in episode 3. He’s so good at guitar. Give him a spinoff already!!! Cmon!!
10,ele 🪷,,4.0,wirt just wanted to give his girl a mixtape of his poetry and him playing the clarinet and I want him to know that I support him

12,James (Schaffrillas),,3.5,"Reminds me of Infinity Train Season 1! You know, the nice, charming, good one that paved the way for the masterpieces that were Seasons 2 and 3  Though to be fair Infinity Train doesn't have Greg"
13,feat. dante from the dmc series,,5.0,"here, eat your dirt."
14,Karst,,5.0,CHILLS when the highway man shows up
15,SilentDawn,,4.5,"83  For the autumn leaves and the candle-light, for the crescent moon and the creatures roaming storied paths in which they find solace; a new world is granted for two young boys, discovering that reality is merely a journey from one grove to another. As touching as it is expressive, this miniseries is carried by the wind towards the chill of a slowly setting sun; an experience lifted by levity and pummeled by adolescent awkwardness. At once a poisoned treat for the onset of Fall and a reminder of its clammy, eternal embrace. Such a cozy, wonderful thing."
16,kj,,5.0,why read dante’s inferno when you can watch this instead
17,amaya,,5.0,i mean it's fine! it's ok. it's not like i've heard the soundtrack more times than my father's voice. i definitively enjoy this a normal amount
18,Sally Jane Black,,Unrated," A lot has been written about the depth and beauty of the animation here, so I won't belabor it. I don't have the technical knowledge to add to that discussion, anyway. I will say that I enjoyed it, especially the tone it set with its color palette and the throwback feeling of certain parts (the cloud city part especially seemed to harken back (thanks, nabbers)). The other technical aspects of this were generally fairly impressive as well--the music was delightful…"

24,demi adejuyigbe,,4.0,honestly i was tired and in a post-IT fugue when i watched this so i dozed off for a lil bit but this is so sweet and funny and lovely and i’m actually excited to watch it again
25,CinemaJoe,,4.5,A good example of an experience that’s enhanced tenfold when it’s watched surrounded by friends.  Someone play two old cats with me now.

27,aleph beth null,,4.5,"eighth or maybe ninth rewatch and i'm still discovering new little connections and kindnesses in this relentlessly melancholy (kierkegaardian?) work of love. bodies and the material world are affirmed all over the place:  — auntie whispers and adelaide are never ever mocked for their frames or non-passing voices — bells stubbornly remain stuck inside frogs even outside the unknown — resurrected pottsfielders require glorified/pumpkinified bodies (reclaiming the satires of seneca jr, zomg) — 'no, no, not a wish, i'm not…"

30,nathaxnne [hiatus <3],,5.0,"To find oneself in a dark wood, not in the middle of life, but somewhere closer to its start, would indeed be maybe better, a pilgrim without progress, where you were is where you were all along and you were there and you were there and you were there from the fall on into the winter and the waiting until spring. The stories that aren't true might be true anyway or at least illuminatory, as something to burn that gives…"

32,adambolt,,3.5,if i ever get lost in the forest i want Greg with me at all times
33,Fam Squad Yeet,,5.0,"Over the Garden Wall is on of those rare shows that are masterfully crafted. Like Adventure Time it perfectly captures that sense of Child-like whimsicality for adventure and the underlying evils of the world. The show is dark and moody with it’s perfect animation, brown color palette, and mysterious score. Yet it’s so light with its message and star-eyed Gregory’s knack for looking at the best side of everything."
34,celia,,4.0,it’s just a wholesome lil show about 2 brothers in purgatory and i like it very much

36,reibureibu,,4.5,"Takes me back to a place in my life where the world was simpler and I was happier. Both of which, to be fair, were mostly due ignorance, but I can't say I don't miss it.  The falls at my campus were some of the most beautiful I've ever seen. There's something real special about the golden-brown myriad of leaves pigmenting the streets, the gentle nippy drafts which coax out the coat-layering expert in us all, the encroaching time of…"

38,Caleb Johnson,,5.0,"This was a weird experience. Not due to the content of this, but due to the circumstances in which I started to watch this. I was asleep for the night, but then had one of those nights where I kinda just randomly woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't get back to sleep. So you better believe your boy popped on the TV to watch something. I don't know what made me think of it, but I suddenly remembered I…"

44,jeaba,,5.0,the best movie to watch at the beginning of september. happy over the garden wall season everyone!!
45,Sam Thompson,,Unrated,"I wish Greg was my son. But ONLY if he stays this age forever.  A clear sign that a show is an all timer for me is that when I finish it, I simultaneously feel sad and satisfied. Satisfied because it is complete but sad because the journey is over and I can't see more of the characters I have fallen in love with.  Ain't that just the way..."
46,Jessica Wessica,,3.5,"Greg the Egg was my favorite character  ""We're here to burgle your turts"""
47,Tay,,Unrated,"if we all have burdens to bear,  Over the Garden Wall  suggests that our trials and tribulations may not have to be borne alone, nor does a descent down into darkness have to be devoid of light.  Nate Cash's reimagining of a forested Inferno is strange and magical, comedic and melancholic. there are such sinister implications and undertones to  OtGW,  but it never relents to its own pain. Wort and Greg and their cohort of companions are charming, stubborn, and…"

53,Wesley R. Ball,,4.5,"I was unaware that Cartoon Network shows can also be cinema.  I've been in some kind of slump out of watching movies lately and I've gotten myself lost in the worlds of Adventure Time and Regular Show. I'm kind of trying to get some changes made in my current life situation that created some strange addiction to watching Adventure Time nearly nonstop, like it actually takes me to some safe, happy place that reminds me of a simpler time in…"
54,"Rafael ""Parker!!"" Jovine",,4.5,"Ok, so long story short.... as I grow up and enter my teenage years, my mom did everything in her powers to actually have me hate cartoons (mostly because I spent talking like a kid), which sorta worked (I say sorta because I kept watching live action TV til very long into my twenties). So of course, its been FOREVER since I watched Cartoon Network as a whole, therefore you can imagine the abundant level of nostalgia that logo with…"
55,Alice Stoehr,,3.5,"This musical fantasy evokes a range of influences—The Wizard of Oz, Spirited Away, Edward Gorey, the Fleischer Bros.—while sustaining a glissando across a whole spectrum of emotions, from goofy to wistful to heartbroken and back again. It's a world of its own, sparkling new but faintly familiar. (Here's Christopher Lloyd, and there's Tim Curry: the cartoon antagonists of decades past.) Jokes and myths, which I suspect may be interchangeable, accumulate into a compact edifice that you can ascend and gaze down from, at which point you may as well clamber back down and watch all ten episodes again."
56,Felipe,,5.0,I love everything about this. You like fall? You like frogs? frogs in old timey suits? Pumpkins? Watch this. It's a halloween must-see.
57,jeaba,,5.0,the perfect watch for a rainy day. so cozy!!

59,Leighton Trent,,4.5,"As precious and as magical as anything Cartoon Network has produced.   Nothing else puts me in the spirit of Halloween, and Autumn in general, like this does 🎃 🍂       💀 All the Spooks 2021 💀"
60,maiapog,,5.0,"""It's even growing inside him!"" ""No, I was just eating leaves.""  Re-watched this morning while sipping on a pumpkin latte... IT'S FALL BABY! A perfect show.

61,Sally Darr,,4.5,all of this because Wirt wanted to give a girl a mixtape of him reading poetry and playing clarinet playing he’s a keeper and Greg can burgle my turts with doctor cucumber any day
62,brynn helena,,5.0,"this is regular show but for queer, dark academia kids"
63,🌻 lindsay 🌻,,5.0,"My love for this show comes from the same part of me that feels a swell of happiness when I feel the crisp air of fall.   Summer has never been a time of the year where I feel relaxed. It’s actually always been the most stressful times of the year for me. When I was younger, it was a break in my routine that went on for too long. When I have nothing that I have to do, I just…"

67,Justin Decloux,,5.0,"The perfect Fall Watch.   It's got dancing pumpkin skeletons, an amazing rock fact-centric sense of humour, and creepy concepts strained through 30s Fleischer cartoon imagery. Does this feature the last example of John Cleese giving a hilarious performance?   I know it's got a cult following, but I can only imagine how packed the shelves of Hot Topic would be with GARDEN WALL: merch if this had been released as a theatrical film.   And so the story is complete and everyone is satisfied with the ending. And so on and so forth..."
68,claira curtis,,5.0,"“Where… are we?”  “In the woods.”  “I mean… what are we doing out here?”  “We’re walking home!”   Where a forest is not just a forest, a walk home is not just a simple home, an ask for help can bode more harm than aid, a lantern may cast a larger shadow rather than shine a light in the dark, and where the thing that matters most in this world, and the next, is your brother.   It’s time for fall. It’s time for the yearly Over the Garden Wall rewatch. It’s time to come home."
69,Wade,,Unrated,Instant Masterpiece
70,Lee ॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ,,5.0,"If dreams can't come true, then why not pretend?  Both a campfire horror about grief and the terror of the passing of time, and a whimsical fairy tale about responsibility and self determination. Note how many scenes involve a character telling a story. Cant help but well up over the Woodsman."

78,Jesusmary,,5.0,"Warning: Spoiler(s) ahead!   Man, I've never expected that I'd be bawling my eyes out over a cutesy CalArts-drawn animation. I know ominous twists were lying low out there but I genuinely did not see the last two episodes bushwhacking the heck out of my emotions coming. It was as though they were just biding their time hidden amongst the overcast amber of squash and autumn leaves, lulling me with a false sense of ease and assurance that the series will…"
79,kat🕷,,5.0,"""Over the Garden Wall"" may initially seem like a show for kids, but this mix of autumnal melancholy, surreal humor and American folklore (turkeys, pumpkins, village schools, etc.) it‘s not only far too dark in some places for younger kids, it‘s also contains numerous references, allusions to mythology and scope for interpretation, which will probably only be accessible to adults. In addition, the series has also very beautifully drawn visuals and old background music."

I want chilly weather and sweaters and a hot coffee right now.   It’s just such a great little fantasy for kids and adults. It’s spooky but not scary. It’s deep but still full of humor.

110,Fred 🇵🇷,,3.5,"Cozy, casually grim, and wonderfully realized, there is a lot to like about the adventures of Over the Garden Wall. The character and locale designs in this are reason enough to check it out. Story-wise, for the most part, this worked for me despite not packing the kind of punch that similar Cartoon Network fantasy fare has pulled off (Adventure Time comes to mind). Only in the borderline obnoxiously cutesy and oddly elementary school-appropriate singalongs, of which there are about…"
111,Big Rig,,4.5,"Despite its wild creativity and fantastical elements, Over the Garden Wall is eerily familiar and surprisingly grounded. This series is very alike Studio Ghibli films in the sense that it understands that there is a certain magic that exists in the world; it may not be the mystical creatures pictured in this show, but the artistry (yes, this series is, first and foremost, a piece of art) and storytelling that suspends our disbelief, and invites us into a world that makes…"

Brother Wirt lives by impotence and anxiety, brother Greg lives by the strength of the absurd, and both have got to bear witness to those truths which the Unknown offers in order to make anything worthwhile of the Known. Well, existentialists will settle for their “loveliest lies” over truth, but…"

115,Siena 🌞,,5.0,This miniseries is so genuinely pure that I can't even think of a sassy one liner and honestly that's beautiful
116,Danny,,5.0,That feeling when you finally watch something for the first time and instantly you know you are adding this to your yearly fall required viewings. What a delight.
117,Movies “Mofa” Fan123,,Unrated,Very cute miniseries! I enjoyed it for sure. Very nice vibes and I liked the darker horror aspects to it. Definitely one of the better Cartoon Network shows though they definitely have had some bangers throughout the years (Regular Show supremacy). The voice acting and characters were great. I liked the odd characters they met during the journeys. It mixes a lot of great genres. I don’t think I loved it as much as the rest of Letterboxd but it is a great series for sure!  And that’s a Rock Fact🪨

The animation was beautiful and the story was so wholesome and sweet! It was also a little spooky and sad! But done in such a great way. I loved these characters and their dynamic with each other.

Es increíble como en tan solo 10 capítulos de 10 minutos lograron contar una travesía que me hizo llorar al final.  Aunque me quedé con varias dudas y teorías formadas por mi cabeza, me da la sensación que no importa cuantas veces llegue a ver esta serie en el futuro siempre encontraré pequeños detalles que alimenten a este mundo un poco más. Me gustaría ampliamente recomendar esta serie a todo aquel que disfrute de los viejos cuento de hadas. Es sensacional."
132,matthewcutchen,,4.0,"Such relaxed and wholesome creepiness and existentialism.   Legitimately felt like those animated characters were making the whole thing up on the spot.  Not a huge fan of super on-the-nose self-aware “genre savvy” jokes. Maybe if I had watched it when it came out back in 2014 I would have liked that aspect more, but at this point that’s feeling a little played out. Still overall really enjoyed it.   Something I did love was how they kept subverting villain tropes. And Greg. Greg was hilarious.  Definitely one of those “movies i can’t believe exist but i’m so glad they do”."

Over the Garden Wall, on the other hand, feels like it took my life and made it into a miniseries set in a mystical, eerie world, and because…"

Unending in its old-timey New England coziness and plays out like a half-remembered daydream.  Full of irreverence and hazy set pieces that seep into your bone marrow and last for a lifetime, imbued with a childlike fascination of folktales that's as wondrous as it is foreboding.  An absolute seasonal classic in every respect."

Now, where did that frog named ‘Kitty’ go?”  Something about these two brothers in this dusty autumn lost in the deep parts of some magical woods instills this wondrous sense of joy in me.

There was definitely a good bit in Obama's second term where I got swept up by, like, Steven Universe like a lot of other people old enough to drink did, as around this time Cartoon Network entered a triumphant new era of novel and interesting animation.

Lifetime film #5,000, per Letterboxd, and it's appropriately not even actually a film. Over the Garden Wall is such a perfect balance of tone, playing the dangerous, dark unknown against the wholesome warmth of brotherhood and friendship.

153,ZombieTrex,,5.0,"Over the Garden Wall is often categorized as a story about death, and while the themes of mortality remain one of its most prominent aspects, I want to make the case that the show is also about life. It’s about being confronted with death and learning how to move on without regrets. It’s about realizing harsh realities, but remaining determined in spite of that. To put it simply, it’s about kids who come very close to death through the dangers…"

156,Liam,,4.5,Episode 1: 8/10 that dog was nightmare fuel.   Episode 2: 8/10 I thought that dog was night mare fuel. That pumpkin giant was terrifying.  Episode 3: 9/10 banger comedy and an actual banger in “potatoes and molasses”.   Episode 4: 8/10 first look at the beast and it did not disappoint. Definitely giving adventure time and gravity falls vibes but more eerie tbh.   Episode 5: 6/10 the comedy wasn’t hitting the same and the vibe wasn’t like the last 4 episodes. …
157,4ntun,,5.0,"Wirt, you can do anything if you set your mind to it.  A fable of compassion and a triumph of imagination. Two lost boys wandering the Unknown, a talking bluebird accompanying them, an old woodsman guarding the light of life and the Beast singing their requiem, every day and every night. A must watch."
158,EccyReviews,,4.5,"Potato’s and Molasses.Best Song Ever!!!  I just Binged the Hell out of this and I loved every minute. Greg is 100% my favourite character was in hysterics ever second he was on the screen. The story is so deep talking about death,friendship and love and Cartoon Network are incredible with their animation. Each episode was important to the show and I loved how Wirt and Greg had effects on every character they interacted with. I highly recommend this if you get the chance as you will have a blast.  👏👏🌲🥔❤️😂🐸🐦🏮🎥🎥"

Each character is rendered with mounds of care, as is each fantastical place they find themselves on their journey. I'd like to rewatch this and think on the ending…"

The voice acting was solid (shoutout Elijah Wood, Christopher Lloyd, John Cleese) and the characters were well written and adorable. I laughed many times and the whole thing was charming, multilayered, heartwarming and original.  That last 2 episodes were fantastic. It's just a shame there isn't more."

165,Santi Saw the TV Glow,,5.0,"This was a lovely watch!   I only watched three episodes before and I got bored with it, but after watching it with the fellow patrons of House of Cinema, it’s one of the best animated shows I’ve ever watched from Cartoon Network. Now, Regular Show and Adventure Time are my all-time favs, but within the series’ 10 episodes that are a breezy 10 min. each, it’s carried by it’s creepy atmosphere, creative and compelling characters and original narrative with complex themes of brotherhood, growing up, and in search of determination.  I love Over the Garden Wall and that’s a ROCK FACT!"

I can’t even describe what part of this works this well, almost like magic. It’s genuinely hilarious, cute, exciting and even poignant. A show about not being enough, about being afraid of the world, about coming home. Endlessly displaying an effortless creativity through its beautiful scenarios and even more beautiful visuals that almost transcend the medium of animated kids’ shows. Perfect watch for the season."
168,Nolio,,4.0,"Adventurous and full of heart, Over the Garden Wall is a sweet miniseries created by Cartoon Network. The series is basically about two lost brothers trying to find their way home. Along the way, they encounter all kinds of strange people, things and locations. This series clocks in at about 110 minutes, making it an extremely short watch. The length of the series along with its brilliant little contents had me longing for even more episodes shortly after I finished…"

170,mitch f. anderson,,Unrated,"Over the Garden Wall confirms the golden age of animated series we're in right now. It doesn't hold the cynicism and existential bleakness of current animated hit shows, but it does share with them an underlying melancholy, and a coherent, well-built universe that only feels like it's being made up on the spot (and it also bests their animation styles - if this wasn't hand-drawn, they definitely fooled me). Universally fantastic voice acting, and a true sense of scale. It's only 100 minutes total, but it has the progression and scope of a novel. Basically perfect."

Equal parts funny, charming, spooky, and emotionally moving, Over Garden the Wall remains one of my absolute favourite animated series of all time. Not only is it a joy to watch because of the great 2D animation art-style and lovable characters, it's also fun to pick up on underlying themes and piece things together on your own, as the narrative never overtells.

The distinct art styles and unique interpretations of reality. It allows us to see things reality won’t let us, either because it’s difficult to see or impossible. I love it all.

205,Jeffrey Overstreet,,4.5,"Since this is catalogued on Letterboxd, I feel compelled to archive it as one of the most surprising and satisfying discoveries I've enjoyed in recent years. Its roots reach deep into folklore and fairytales, but it has an absurdist streak that recalls Monty Python, They Might Be Giants, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, and even Fishing With John.

I adore the plotlessness and continuous plot twists in almost each and every episode. It evokes a wide range of other animation-styles and legends.

Stranger Things me dejó con la idea de que la miniserie podría ser lo mejor que le haya pasado al género. Y sí, Over the Garde Wall es una de las mejores películas de horror de los últimos años.   He empacado mis maletas y ya me voy a vivir a esta película donde todo es perfecto. No me volverán a ver nunca."

The creator is a co-writer of Guillermo del Toro's upcoming Pinocchio which is currently getting rave reviews. Looking forward to that even more now."

And featuring pumpkins, dead leaves, apples, roast turkeys, and all things Fall among its imagery. It’s also in the mood. The atmosphere. It’s calming and folksy, charming and quirky.

So I enjoy every single second that this rather short season has to offer.   🕯️Over the Garden Wall is probably the best thing to watch to manifest such a truly beautiful autumn 🕯️  Yet I currently lack the words to describe the charming and heartfelt absurdities of these episodes. However, one thing is for sure: this little magical tale means as much to me from now on as autumn itself!"

To call this show a masterpiece is selling it too short, this a spirtual gutteral experience that never lets go for the whole runtime. Surprisingly my favourite chapter is nine which is the best summary of the mini series themes with Greg's absolutely delightful journey to Dreamland. One of those pieces of media where even it's flaws feel apart of it's design, bravo!"
287,James Betsalel,,4.0,"For fans of Misadventures of Flapjack and Adventure Time, this walks the line of cute and creepy establishing itself as a whimsical contemporary folk tale. It's deeper than appears at first look mirrored by the simple character designs and detailed backgrounds.

Would recommend."

342,Teddy,,4.5,"Sorry, all! School just ain't slowing down anytime soon. Further meaning that I haven't been able to watch anything or really do anything that I would normally.  However, I am working on The Social Network video essay per your request and it's going to be good, so hold tight.  I'm going to keep this review pretty tame and short because of just how ambitious this piece of work is; in no way could I do it justice with my comprehension…"
343,AFilmGuy,,5.0,Maybe the best thing ever.
344,gabs ꩜,,5.0,it’s smokey outside and i’m pretending it’s fall
345,Ken B,,4.0,Okay yep that was really good. And obviously I watched it like a movie. Beautifully animated. Full of heart and humour. I laughed continuously. I might have to own this and make it a Halloween staple.
346,ethanjame,,4.5,"nothing will ever live up to a childhood autumn. i remember the first time i witnessed the seasons changing before my very eyes, the leafs turning from a green light colour to colours which matched my bright red hair, watching the sun go from bright yellow to slow orange. the nights coming in thicker and the days feeling lighter and less intense. it felt like a revival, i always hated summer, but i loved autummn. for days i would walk…"
347,Izabela,,5.0,"Cute ,funny,spooky,eerie felt like a cozy autumn night."
348,Liam Fitzgibbon,,4.5,Lowkey depressed about finishing this because now I'll never get to watch it for the first time again. Pure magic. The coziest thing I've ever seen.
349,Mister Cap,,4.0,"Diese kleine Serie (10 Folgen zu jeweils ca. 11 Minuten) ist wirklich ein Kunstwerk und vereint auf einzigartige Art und Weise Comedy, Spaß, Drama und Horror. Ja, sogar Horrorelement findet man hier, da die Serie die Prämisse etabliert dass sich selbst in der scheinbar harmlosesten Situation, ein schreckliches Geheimnis verbergen könnte.   Diese Miniserie - alles in allem ist sie nicht länger als ein Spielfilm - beweist auch eindrucksvoll, dass es keine lange, zähe Zeichentrickserie braucht, die über mehrere Staffeln läuft,…"
350,🦇🕷cecilie🕷🦇,,5.0,"the perfect thing to put on in the background while cleaning your room and contemplating your life <3 wirt is totally my emotional support character.  also, normalize seeing this not only during fall"
351,Griffin Schiller,,4.5,If fall was a movie (mini-series)...it would be Over the Garden Wall. What a delight!
352,Aelwyd,,4.5,"OTGW is a charming, fantastical adventure between two brothers travelling to visit Adelaide and to discover purpose and meaning along the way; might it be a place where music is always playing, love is in the air and unlikely friendships form.   If you're looking for a quaint and wholesome film to cozy up to this fall, look no further!"
353,Brahski,,5.0,"No giving up now, old man! It's got to be a ghost!   But how can you be so certain?  Because I really, really want to see a ghost. Really bad."
354,Max Coombes,,5.0,"""Led through the mist, By the milk-light of moon, All that was lost, is revealed""  What have we lost, and how is it going to be revealed? If it's something we once had, then it must be something we're familiar with, surely? What will it mean when we find it again? Nostalgia in politics speaks to something being lost, and appeals to our desire to return to some home that never was. It is tempting to shut it out given…"
355,Jordan Smith,,Unrated,"Now that I've rewatched it a year later, Over the Garden Wall is one of my favorite pieces of animation from this decade, if not my flat-out favorite. I love that it progresses from the zany, continuity-averse nature of cartoons into something heartbreaking and grounded. The swampy, autumnal aesthetic is gorgeous as well and makes it a perfect Halloween/Thanksgiving tradition."
356,Wyatt Fair,,5.0,one of those amazing things…happy halloween
357,⠀ ೀ ⠀ hazel r. ⠀ ⠀,,5.0,ITS FINALLY OTGW SEASON
358,Daniel Johnson,,Unrated,So unfathomably sweet. This is not of this Earth. We do not deserve this. It is too nice.
359,leeann,,5.0,better than tarantino and nolan’s entire filmography combined

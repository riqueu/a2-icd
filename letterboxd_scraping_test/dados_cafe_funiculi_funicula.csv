0,Idar Jar,4,"Itu ngapa cover filmnya ada logo gramedianya anjer, apakah yg input adalah orang Indonesia???   Cafe funiculi funicula, mengisahkan tentang sebuah cafe yang memiliki rumor atau magic, bisa mengantarkan orang ke masa lalu tetapi dengan bermacam macam aturan yang nyusahin banget. Kalau judul filmnya si makenya before the coffe gets cold, yang nge reveal salah satu syarat ketika mau kembali ke masa lalu.   Agak tricky ketika mau mengadaptasi sebuah novel menjadi sebuah film, karna padatnya isi buku harus disesuaikan dengan durasi…"
1,barbie,3.5,"due to my major government exams, i gave myself a book ban (obvs that means no reading anything bc i can get carried away w that -.-“) and when it was finally over, i went to my local bookstore. i never do any research on what my next read should be - i always touch the book spines and see which calls me (same w movie CDs). i picked up the “before the coffee gets cold” book and i finished…"
2,rencydiane,1,You won't like this if you've read the book. Didn't bother finishing this movie.
3,knrview,2,finished books no 1 and no 2 didnt like both didnt like this too might as well let the coffee get cold
4,lordfarticus,2.5,Watched because it’s one of my girlfriend’s favorite movies. Uhhhh yeah not really that good to be honest ごめん 知美.
5,veeaaornon,2," Everything happened so quickly, quite unexpected too. I’m not sure if that’s how it’s supposed to be but I guess it gives the film more character?? or maybe it's just messy...  Hirai san’s arc starts and i feel every emotion known to man kind. Sister dynamics gets me every time. Not quite like the whole mom-daughter thing (didn't resonate with me).  Because up till now, I’ve been doing what I want. Now, you do what you want, Kumi. It’s always…"
6,petya,Unrated,20 minutes in and this is already so much different than the book ahahha
7,zy,3,"film nya ini lebih ceria dan lebih terang ya daripada penggambaran di novelnya, terus menurutku lebih dikembangkan meski aku lebih prefer novelnya sih but this is good enough. Actingnya oke tapi bukan yang oke banget, ya standar jepang lah, terus cara teleportasi nya juga beda dengan versi novel.  btw itu posternya cover novel versi gramedia 😭"
8,peachydariyaa,4,i read the book so i decided to watch it. its not as good as the book but still nice and touching. the stories are amazing and recommend both the book and this
9,Brendan is Afraid,3.5,"As a film, this is a pretty compelling collection of stories and visually striking in how it does it's time travel, but as an adaptation I can't help but feel like they dropped the ball in some ways. I think it all ultimately comes down to preference and how you feel the story should be visually and thematically adapted, as I viewed the time travel and café completely different in my mind. However, the thing that I wasn't particularly sold…"
10,shi qin,3,"many heartwarming subplots which I felt would have worked better if this was a drama series that focused on a different character each episode? as a film with a shorter runtime, those subplots felt a bit disjointed, especially since they don't serve much function to the main story between the mom and her daughter  japanese🇯🇵"
11,kahel 🍊,4.5,There were a lot of stories inside this film and I cried over all of them.
12,grayskyai,4.5,I watched this immediately after reading the book and I can say that I like the movie better.
13,julesia95,3.5,The mother and child story hit harder in the book but it was still a good watch.
14,みちる (Michiru): MITRO CHiRAL,3.5,"When truth hurts, when memories fade, when love breaks down, when time runs out.....what if you could go back to the past, to say something before all that happens?  I've been spending my week reading Before the Coffee Gets Cold (2015) solely for the premise. At a glance, the premise of ""a cafe that can get their patrons back in time but it can't change the present"" intrigued me. Not to mention that I have the perfect album to listen…"
15,nebulazhri,3.5,"""... there's a mysterious urband legend.""  Ini dia kayak gabungin buku pertama sama keduanya deh. Ada penyesuaian juga sama karakternya."
16,Nommit,3.5,"As a huge enjoyer of before the coffee gets cold, I think the movie does an amazing job capturing the charm and feeling of the book. While lacking details and being different in quite some areas (which I think is okay!), the adaptation still has a lot of authenticity and is really great. Liked how the underwater effect for the transformation back in time was done and the approach to kazu's life outside the café. The pacing and focus can however feel a bit confusing at times, and a more clear narrative direction could've probably helped the story"

22,Lettuce Wrapped Cabbage Cat,3.5,"was a little disappointed that they omitted Kei’s storyline from the book but seeing how this movie puts more focus on Kazu and how they integrated Kei’s story into Kazu’s and her mother’s the change was a pleasant retelling of the story. The story of the husband of wife really was able to capture the emotions in the book and since I didnt know they switched the stories of the husband and wife, I first thought Kohtake was Kaname."

26,DetectiveFangir,4.0,"Film simple tapi punya makna dalam. Film tentang time travel memang selalu memberikan pelajaran untuk menghargai waktu, tetapi cara penyampaian di film ini menurutku berbeda dan enak dinikmati.  Menonton film ini tuh awalnya terasa lempeng aja sampai di bagian yang bikin merasa ""oalah begitu ternyata""   Bagi sebagian orang, film ini bisa jadi mudah ditebak tetapi tidak mengurangi keasyikan untuk menontonnya kok."
27,Hamani,3.0,Mid compared to the books but still kinda a good watch

30,karen,2.0,"definitely strayed a bit from the novel, but was an unfortunate failed attempt to be a charming adaptation overall. honestly could have been a cute mini series and would have given an opportunity to go more in depth and nuance into each of the story lines.  really was not sure why they decided to do the ending the way they did; it felt like a comical big pharma television commercial. some other aspects were weird and off-mood as well like…"
31,Juliana Felix,4.0,"Num geral o filme é fofo, mas uma péssima adaptação. Cores e cenas mts bonitas. A transição entre as viagens ficou muitooooo bonita!!!!!! Nao gostei que todas as histórias foram modificadas bruscamente, mas algumas dessas modificações ficaram boas, como ter dado o protagonismo para a Kazu."
32,mscally09,3.5,Maybe the only movie I’ve watched in 9 times over the course of 3 months. Let’s start by stating that it doesn’t help to get the most immersive experience.  But a nice way to improve your languages skills  I enjoyed the two sisters’ story the most. 私は二人の姉妹の話しが一ばん好きです。

34,POV,4.0,"Heartwarming and heart-wrenching.   The story is divided into four parts (as I remember because I watched it a long time ago). All explores different types of relationship and different problems within those relationships. Friends whose feeling weren’t revealed, husband and his wife who developed dementia, sister relationship where one died in an accident, and mother and child relationship. One person went back in time to meet their loved one in a significant moment even though they knew they couldn’t…"

37,Siskoid,4.0,"Adapted from the novel Before the Coffee Gets Cold, Café Funiculi Funicula is a sweet and sentimental film set in a café where one special seat can allow you to time travel... according to some very stringent rules. Set up as an anthology, it soom becomes apparent that the reserved barista Kazu has a date with destiny as well. The other patrons are thus our way to learn the rules, the film's way to make us smile or shed a…"
38,gebi,3.0,try not to tweak in the past challenge (impossible)  Strong 6/10
39,cheycoote,4.0,"i loved this adaptation, i think they did an amazing job at adapting the characters and their stories to a film, and loved how we got to look closer at kazu’s character"
40,diomio,3.0,A fun little sweet quirky movie where the nurse arc hit way too hard
41,CHOPZDUB,3.0,"I think its actually a real fun movie, sometimes the music choice was confusing and I think didnt make sense but I thought the overall plot was fun"
42,Weazeltown,4.0,"Beautiful little film, made my stupid little heart hurt, although I think it would’ve been gorgeous animated, and there were points where the music was so wildly inappropriate for the vibe of the scene that it was a little silly."
43,itsgeorgee,3.5,Bit different than the books however was enjoyable and a good adaptation!
44,Milk__,3.0,Robert De Niro mentioned 💯💯‼️
45,zoe ✰,3.5,"so sweet. i loved the scene w kazu and her mother, probably the best one in the film."

47,camile,3.0,impossivel esse mlk do filme nao ser o joji caralho igualzinho
48,Henk,3,"This was a bit too wholesome and sentimental for me.   Focusing first on 3 customers and their time travel, before finally going to our pretty Kazu and the ghost.   It was nice to see 80s icon Hiroko Yakushimaru in a smallish role."
49,FishEstrella,2,"I just finished the 4th book in the Before the Coffee Gets Cold series and was very excited to see this adaptation.   Unfortunately, it’s kinda wack.  The way the movie visualizes the time travel is actually pretty rad, but it doesn’t actually take many stories from the book series.  As an adaptation, it’s weak. As its own thing, it’s melodramatic Hallmark-quality schlock. Very disappointing."
50,hiba,3,makes you reflect on your life choices and regrets :(
51,SpookyWhan,4,even if you can't fix anything but still want to return to that time in just a moment before the coffee get cold   —at café funiculi funicula   😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
52,Tommy Rutigliano,4,I really enjoyed this more then the first book in the series which was stiffly translated in English a few years back. I thought the cast was golden and the setting and soundtrack was gorgeous. Some sappy and cringe moments especially from the first story.  This would have worked a thousand times better if it was a limited series instead of a movie because lots of things get rushed much like in the book. Going to read the second one now! Looking forward to returning to the cafe 💕
53,Raquelblss,3,This was cute just like the book  The mother daughter part had me crying
54,Jas_e,3,j’ai regardé le film pcq c’est l’adaptation du livre «Tant que le café est encore chaud » (que je n’ai bien évidemment pas lu) mais dont j’ai entendu du bien.   l’histoire se passe dans un café où on peut retourner dans le passé pendant que le café qui nous a été servi est encore chaud (tout est dans le titre en fait) et d’autres règles…   on suit les regrets de clients habituels qui n’ont pas su dire ce qu’ils avaient sur…
55,Lana,1.5,unbearably long and completely unnecessary to make into a movie. enjoyed the book quite a bit and could see the potential if this were a series. felt really bad afterwards bcs the writer/director came up for a q&a and i was thoroughly bored
56,MonarcaBR,3.5,"7,5/10. Antes que o café esfrie tem uma ideia interessante, desenvolvida de uma forma simples e legal, abordando temas sensíveis como luto e trazendo algumas reflexões."
57,Jay Wood,Unrated,"After reading the Before the coffee gets cold (a series of books that I found repetitive but harmless to read on a train) I thought I would check out the movie adaptation. And it’s okay. A little too dry, and while there’s some nice flourishes (especially in the time travel moment) I do find this film, and the series of books, just don’t have a lot of stakes to it.  The coffee is lukewarm at best."
58,Abin,2.5,pengen balik ke masa lalu juga😔
59,izz💥t,5,ok just finished watching this film after reading the first book a month ago and i could say it's just as cute and tear-jerking film! it's a bit odd that they'd exchanged kohtake and fusagi and i didn't expect that kazu got a love interest here (she probably had one in other books but oh well).

64,Jessica Yeung,3.0," An urban fantasy film about a cafe that can transport its visitors to the past and future, Before the Coffee Gets Cold is an overtly magical film underpinned by morals about living in the present and treasuring friendships, love relationships, and family relationships least regrets happen later.

79,Henrique Coelho,1.5,"just read the book instead.  The pacing is really weird and they changed EVERYTHING; I understand that adaptations have to change some things, but most of the changes here are pointless and stupid. The book was nowhere near well-translated into a movie."
80,apricotteaa,5.0,"based on the novel Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Junwa Kawaguchi. All of us must have had the desire to travel through time. Maybe to the past or the future with the hope that when we can penetrate the time dimension we can improve the situation. if we had a time machine, there would be places we would like to visit again or people we would like to see again. There is a reality that we want to change.…"
81,Barbora Sopoligova,2.0,"I really enjoyed Kawaguchi's novel Before Coffee Gets Cold. I like the premise, the time travel idea in a setting as simple as a coffee shop (Jim Jarmusch vibes). Ever since I read it, I wanted to make a short film based on the book. Then I heard the movie already exists. In my head, I imagined the movie to be very absurd, weird, fun, and I expected a deep dive into each characters' stories, the story has a lot…"
82,MooFaan,4.0,"Read the first book from the trilogy. Kinda have a bit spin off about the rules and characters switching but that's fine it still doesnt take away the goodness of it.

89,penel,3.0,"An intriguing time-travel premise that could have been much better if used in a drama concept. The acting and the almost stage-play filming were good, but the subplots felt unrelated and, though there were some touching moments here and there, overall something was missing."

97,Andrew J. Eisenman,4.5,"One of my favorite books that I read this year, I ordered the Blu-Ray immediately and wrote extensively about it on Goodreads.   The story of Cafe Funiculi Funicula is at its heart, about the power of words.

117,dinchung,4.0,一貫日本抒情電影作風，節奏風格偏平淡緩慢咁帶出珍惜、遺憾、幸福嘅主題  雖然穿越時間嘅題材已經用到爛，但我比較appreciate作者嘅設定上加咗「回到過去係無法改變已經發生了的事實」，宜家多數電影會有祖父悖論，改變回去會影響未來。但呢部電腦就係話比你知人生就係會有遺憾，即使返到回去知道未知嘅事都唔能夠改變，但係未來仲未發生，唯一可以改變嘅係自己嘅想法同行動，再自身去改變未來
118,Houari Yahiaoui,3.0,This time travel movie is kind of unique in its approach of how people's lives are affected by going back in time. They do not necessarily have to do things differently for the future to change.

JUST PICK ONE) so maybe it might work better as a miniseries for us to see some proper character development for Kazu (and her r/ship with Shintani, and her cousin) but maybe i'm too greedy... also pleasantly surprised to find this streaming on disney+!!! now to read the novels that this movie is based on..."
127,splashyminion,4.5,"This movie is a journey overall. Mystery, tragedy, romance, and full of emotion this is my introduction to Japanese cinema and I am very impressed. The story could have easily been a sci-fi thriller but surprisingly works very well as a drama. I was really moved by some scenes. It is a very powerful and touching drama."

It's not ideal for a movie, especially one that's so confined to a single space. Each segment more or less turns out the same, as well, the stories stuck to a dramatic pattern of emotional growth through very limited time travel.  The central relationship provides a throughline, but it doesn't provide…"

And while I've seen a lot of these films, I've rarely seen one that tells its story on such a small scale in such an intimate way.

151,Tomato33,4.0,最讓人驚豔的是本片真是集結好多美女演員......  有村架純、石田百合子、波瑠、吉田羊、藥師丸博子這都什麼老中青各代女神雲集......好喜歡  劇情上的話非常簡單，甚至簡單到會對裡面的演員有點生氣，靠夭你們怎麼那麼蠢都想不到的那種。  但情感上還是很容易被感動，畢竟是面對逝去親人那種喚不回的懊悔，給予彼此的祝福、重新開始的和解，都是很直接且強大的觸動啊。  第一組的二美子跟五郎，這對比較沒什麼感覺，畢竟是要循序漸進的情緒，他們重要的不是回到並改變過去，而是讓現在的自己有所領悟並能去影響未來，二美子最後想通，幸福要自己去把握，猶猶豫豫的傳了訊息給五郎表示我想見你，能收到一句我會等你，真是萬幸又美好啊。  第二組的房木夫妻，太太一直細微的驚慌和刻意感演得好好，後來揭露失智症患者的身分以及對先生來不及送出的話，兩人都是以自己希望對方好的心在體貼著對方，太太寫的信裡，那句我希望你不要以護理師的身分照顧我，想跟你當一輩子的夫妻，最後兩人也因為如此而找到了平衡的相處狀態。  第三組的羊姐姊妹，嗚嗚好難過，從一開始出現在咖啡店就表現的游刃有餘，彷彿世間沒有什麼能攔住他的腳步，面對妹妹的態度也是一貫的逃避，明明知道離開家的自己其實是很任性的在揮霍妹妹的青春跟夢想，把她綁在自己不想面對的事情上，在非常突然的接獲妹妹過世的消息之後才驚醒已經失去了自己最重要的某個部分，且在失去之前早已無數錯過彌補的機會，表面上是淡然面對，轉過身來卻是痛苦懊悔不已。  回到過去跟妹妹見了一面道了歉卻更讓人心疼，原來妹妹的夢想一直都是跟姐姐一起經營旅館，她一直逃避的並不是摧毀了妹妹夢想的罪惡感，而是逃避了她無數的愛，然而也已經來不及了呀，前面兩組人都是沒有改變過去，但是透過現在的重新開始來改變未來，但逝去的人是真的離開了，羊姐最後那句撕心裂肺的我只想再見她一面，還有房木太太刻意拖慢幽靈腳步的小舉動，這段真是讓人沉浸在情緒裡難過死了。  百合子姐姐真的好漂亮…  很前面就猜到幽靈其實就是小數的母親，卻猜錯以為她是早知道自己將不久於世，所以試著用這個方法把自己永遠留在這個時空，沒想到她回的不是過去，而是去未來見女兒一面，而這一面也因為太捨不得女兒而把自己永遠的困住。  小數在回到過去見到母親時，時間到了該走了，卻不願意喝下咖啡時哭喊著我不要，我不想離開你的模樣跟小時候聖誕樹前的小女孩一模一樣，上一次母親因為她的哭喊而不捨地留下，這一次卻是母親更為堅定地逼她一定要走，你要走，要去更好的未來，儘管我會永遠失去你你也要離開，真的好痛，哭到不行。
152,avocado cat,1.5,"Its a nice idea to go back in time during coffee but the execution was quite lacklustre. There are various detached stories that feel more like binge watching a series of episodes instead of a movie and once the story picks up it makes no sense and there is the typical romcom idea that a super cute super nice girl cant find a date.. meh  As for japan, all the episodes are basically regret for not expressing their feelings properly so I guess japanese can relate to this stuff. Some individual stories might be nice as a series but overall didn’t quite work for me"

BEFORE THE COFFEE GETS COLD ist dabei durchaus unterhaltend und spricht hinter seiner federleichten Oberfläche sehr ernste Themen an, dabei kippt er aber immer wieder ins stark moralisierende Erzählen.   Die Location wie der zerhackte Plot, der am Ende mühsam zusammen gezwungen wird, lassen eher an ein verfilmtes Theaterstück denken (oder eine steife TV-Inszenierung), als an einen cinematischen Spielfilm. Und wenn…"

157,Mia,3.5,Another spin on the time travel trope with a café that allows the customer to travel to any point in time until the coffee gets cold. 2/3 of the movie are short stories about various customers and the rules of the place. These felt more like a television. Only the final act shows the relationship between the café owner and the mysterious guest.

163,Bopp,3.0,"An unique plot surrounding a time travelling cafe that unravels into a heartwarming, if a little predictable, tale that is emotionally cathartic and fulfilling.

Keeping my eye on Arimura in the future--I really enjoyed her performance.  The sappiness didn't let up though, and would have benefited from some balance. The first of the little vignettes (for lack of a better term) was lighthearted and then I cried for 1.5 hours straight. Also the ""recaps"" at the end felt like a pharmaceutical ad.

178,Alex Holmes,3.5,[Japanese Film Festival 2020 Plus]   “The heart can change over just one cup of coffee. The heart can change.”   A sweet and eccentric premise (time travelling coffee shop with rules around that) allows for a narrative of emotional catharsis. Patrons can go back in time for a short period (till their coffee gets cold) and not change events (the rules say nothing can be changed in the future) but alleviate regrets and say the things they’d wished they’d said. 4…
179,Quinn,3.5,"This sci-fi tearjerker lays it on pretty thick in parts, but the super-specific time travel parameters and (at the risk of sounding basic) all the coffee content, since I really, really like coffee, made it one I didn't want to miss. There's a joke somewhere in those passing lines about the upcoming 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, considering this is a time travel film - I'll leave it up to someone else to conceive something."

183,glassteajar,3.0,"I still had my doubts about less than halfway through but this ended up being more entertaining than expected. Was a roller coaster of emotions, visually pleasing (~coffee shop vibes~) and overall a feel-good, thoughtful, human movie. Loveeeed the bonus cuteness during the credits, the soundtrack and the acting. Some moments could have been more concise and maybe done differently to actually take my tears, and being an adaptation of two novels meant the pacing and plot needed some getting used to.

It did a lovely job of weaving together the five stories and having a resolution for each of them, by really just emphasizing that although you can’t change what’s already happened you can change how you feel about it and move forward. A simple message that was told in 4/5 sad stories, but with people who found their own sense of happiness. I could have lives without the first story, but I guess it was better to start with a more lighthearted one."

Setiap cerita perjalanan waktunya menandai hubungan yang berbeda, tetapi semuanya sukses menyampaikan pesan yang sama, yaitu untuk selalu berdamai dengan masa lalu dan menjalani hidup dengan sebaik-baiknya tanpa rasa sesal."
227,Bilal Rhadeya,2.5,"bisa ke masa lalu dengan secangkir kopi, ya sound stupid 😂"
228,Invincible Asia,Unrated,"This will need a rewatch, not because I watched it on a plane, but because this is the film where an elderly lady who sat in my row decided to get up and fall unconscious in the corridor. That took me slightly out of the film/I had more important stuff to do. Couldn't be arsed to skip back 40 minutes after she was alright again, so, sorry Kasumi Arimura."
229,jazmindelrio,5,this was so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
230,mechanisa_,4,"pesan nya sangat kuat,  bikin kita sadar, bahwa waktu yang telah lewat ga akan pernah bisa kita ulangi lg, ga akan bisa memperbaiki apa yang sudah terjadi, ""Waktu memang kejam, jika kita malas/ menyia-nyiakan sesuatu,  sekarang dan masa depan akan segera jadi masa lalu, yang harus kita pikirkan adalah, apa yang kita tidak mau kehilangan itu,, "" sangat menyentuh, sedihh, tentang keluarga, suami istri, adik kakak, cinta, sahabat, recomended !"

Cafe Funiculi Funicula (2018)  Directed by : Ayuko Tsukahara Release date : Sept 21, 2018 Starring : Kasumi Arimura, Kentaro Ito, Motoki Fukami, Haru  Sebuah film drama fantasi yang diangkat dari novel karya Toshikazu Kawaguchi berjudul “Coffee ga Samenai Uchi ni” ini mengangkat tentang perjalanan ke masa lalu dengan cara suguhan kopi di kursi suatu cafe.  Hal yang saya suka dalam premis film ini adalah mereka ke masa lalu tanpa bisa mengintervensi atau merubah kejadian yang telah terjadi. Karena…"

233,Fiqy A Nurcleary,5,"An interisting consept about time travel.  The past can't be changed. But the future hasn't accurred yet, so it depends on you."
234,8432910,Unrated,"once again we have a ""quaint little establishment that solves your problems"" only with a time travel gimmick and lots of coffee.   it's basically a hallmark film but i guess a distinction to make is that japanese hallmark films have real human problems underneath all those layers of cheese. they're usually about how life is shit and more often than not the best thing you can do is to think about things differently. it's probably why they're so effective. it's…"
235,Tia Ayu Sulistyana,5,"Well, I'm speechless after finishing watching this movie. All I can say is that Cafe Funiculi Funicula (2018) is one of the best and most heartwarming Japanese movies that I ever watch.  Honestly, I'm a little bit skeptical about this movie, but I insist to watch it because Kasumi Arimura is one of the actresses. So, yeah, of course, I'll watch this movie.  During the movie, I'm amazed by how well they delivered the story. The idea is so fresh…"
236,REDO ANGGARA,3.5,"Punya konsep bagus sekaligus unik melibatkan kopi yg harus diminum sebelum dingin dgn time travel. Film asal negara sakura ini ternyata punya kisah yg menyentuh lewat perjalanan waktu dilalukan oleh para karakter. Tentang memaafkan, mengikhlas kan dan berdamai dgn masa lalu. Memang tak terlalu mengharu biru tapi pesan nya mengalir lancar hingga ditutup dgn ending yg membuat pipi mu sembap.  Exceeds Expectation (3,5/5)"
237,ghost,4,"well, time to edit that best of 2018 list.  whoever did the score really wanted me on the ground and in tears, huh? kasumi is beautiful, glowing as always."
238,Agus Indra Adhiputra,4,"Japonis memang gak pernah kehabisan ide untuk membuat sesuatu yg unik. Di suatu kota, suatu kafe, satu kursi spesifik, kita bisa balik ke masa lalu sebelum kopi yg disajikan menjadi dingin. Jalan ceritanya tertulis dengan sangat rapi, dengan sedikit plot twist di akhir, dimana kita dihadapkan pada permasalahan para peran pembantu sebelum masuk ke permasalahan utama. Asalkan kita gak terlalu memikirkan asal-muasal (scientific reason) 'bagaimana caranya kok bisa balik ke masa lalu', movie ini sangat enak buat ditonton, terutama buat penggemar Dorama Jepang."
239,russman,3,This café is not serving their coffee hot enough
240,Cesar Alejandro Jr,4.0,Legitimately touching human drama with a splash of fantasy. Matsushige and Yakushimaru are especially great.
241,lang25,4.0," ""Before the Coffee gets cold""   It represents probably everything I like about Asian cinema. A great story with a nice romance and maybe even a gentle touch of sci-fi that can really engulf me. It had a great slope, an ideal pace, good characters, and also an interesting linking of individual stories through one big story.   The truth is that it is a bit predictable and we can understand some events before they happen. for example, who is a woman…"
242,Saranne,3.5,"Really cool concept.  Loved the underwater sequences.  The film gives in to sentimentality for the final third, but it was thoroughly enjoyable, would watch again."
243,Zoe,4.0,Setting myself up for an emotional rollercoaster every time I watch a Japanese film.
244,ferryriyanto,4.5,"The concept goes back to the past from the four stories between lovers, husband and wife, siblings, and mothers and daughters in one place Cafe. Never as emotional as this. There is a bitter taste then sweet like in a cup of coffee."
245,igna,4.0,"Another movie with time travel from Japan that i really love. Don't forget to watch the credit title, because they were cute family!!!"
246,Nana,3.5,Movie for the one who enjoy slice of life genre
247,Sultan Aulia,3.5,Pecinta kopi senja pasti akan menikmati sekali sajian kopi Funiculi Funicula ini yang membawa penontonnya untuk merenungkan masa lalu agar menatap masa depan secara lebih cerah.
248,Aciel,2.5,"Sebuah Coffee Shop menawarkan time travel kemasa lalu dgn cara meminum kopi dan harus kembali sesaat sebelum kopinya dingin, menarik!! Namun eksekusinya terlalu simple dan membosankan, cast utamanya berwajah mirip Prily Latuconsina."
249,asroer,4.0,"Sinema Jepang memang selalu punya ide unik dalam bermain-main dengan waktu. Cafe Funiculi Funicula pun hadir dengan premis time travel beserta segala macam persyaratan yg tak boleh dilanggar jika tak ingin menerima konsekuensinya. Efek samping bisa bikin mewek, resiko ditanggung sendiri."
250,ngobrolsinema,4.0,"Ide ceritanya fresh dan unik, juga cenderung cukup ringan jadi enak untuk ditonton sambil santai. Bakal ada yang bikin bulu kuduk merinding tapi juga punya momen di beberapa adegan yang akan bikin tersentuh.  Penggambaran perjalanan menjelajah waktu di film ini indah banget. Tapi mungkin akan sedikit mengganggu buat penonton yang punya fobia dengan air.  Untuk hitungan sebuah film yang settingnya hanya terpusat di dalam kafe, film ini cukup melekat di hati. Setiap adegan dan karakternya cukup kuat untuk teringat terus…"

253,laws27,4.0,"A cup of coffee changes people's heart   Konsep yang menarik disuguhkan oleh film jepang ini. Ada sebuah rumor bahwa di coffee shop ini ada sebuah tempat duduk yg akan bisa membawa orang yg duduk di tmpt trsbt ke masa lalu maupun masa depan. Tidak perlu alat canggih dan otak moncernya Tony Stark, cukup dengan segelas kopi yg di seduh dgn metode pour over Kalita, kemudian mengucapkan mantra Before the coffee gets cold."
254,annisa,3.5,"Sesungguhnya mengantisipasi film ini untuk mewek, tapi ternyata nggak sebegitunya kok.  Ide ceritanya unik, meskipun penyajiannya tidak terlalu mengagumkan.  Yang jelas, pesan yang dibawa film tersampaikan dengan baik."

257,maria,3.0,"Really cute and relaxing. The visuals are lovely, they help create a fairytale like atmosphere. A good film to watch on a quiet Sunday afternoon while sipping your coffee, it will keep you company and remind you to drink it while it's hot."
258,fajrianur afnan,3.5,"Treasure what you get, before the coffee gets cold.  Actually a well-thoughtout time travel story with very specific rules entailed, or should I say, four almost separate short stories happening continuously from one to another on the same place. One story might be received better than the others, because really, you can see split them separately and it would've been fine, though this worked well as it is. And when it's good, it's REALLY well done, only drawbacks are some…"

261,Cenit,4.0,When it's good it's really good and will make you cry more than once. Almost all actors do great performances. But the direction sometimes lacks and makes it look too much like anime. Still great. Would recommend.
262,Horrible Reviews,4.0,"Wow I was quite pleasantly surprised by this one!  A Japanese somewhat feel-good drama with sci-fi elements, with the sci-fi elements being time-travel. See, there's this little cafe where if you sit in a specific chair and get served coffee, you can travel back in time for a short period. This does come with a lot of rules/restrictions, the biggest one being that whatever you'll do in the past, can and will in no way affect the present.  It took…"
263,Charles Kurniawan,3.0,"Café Funiculi Funicula has an interesting concept on paper. It is all nice until it tries to complicate itself and be mindblowing by layering time travel concept. It explains the logic behind it, but it still bugs me though.  - SQ In-Flight Entertainment -"
264,Nova Nisa,3.5,"Konsep dan ide ceritanya fresh. Pesan moralnya juga tersampaikan dengan baik. Tiap karakter di sekeliling si tokoh utama juga diberi porsi yg pas sehingga penonton ikut merasakan empatinya, ga cuma sekedar lewat aja. Overall, BAGUS!"

267,miruta,3.5,"A nice and cosy time travel story. The storytelling was a little disjointed, particularly in the opening third of the film, but following that everything else flowed on smoothly. While the characterisations weren't very deep for some, the balance worked in the end with the theme of family and it worked out nicely. Overall a heartwarming film."

270,James Marsh,2,"Cafe Funiculi Funicula employs a fantastical time-travel premise to teach its characters how to seize the moment and let go of their regrets. Inevitably less interested in science fiction than melodrama, the film, based on the novel Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Junwa Kawaguchi, unspools in a series of emotionally rewarding vignettes as customers attempt to reconnect with loved ones from their past.

271,YuJung,5,是一部會讓人想二刷的電影！ 本來是最近實在沒特別想看而湊合著看的 看完之后深受啟發 想要好好的過日子，遠百看完後直奔誠品 想買本2019行事曆，好好規劃自己的人生 之后又買了原著小說，兩天左右就看了2/3 真的很喜歡日本小說不囉唆拖戲的寫作手法 夫婦那段，尤其當先生回到過去，但太太說 「我果然，還是把你給忘了嗎？」 直接淚崩...... 還有小說裡描訴的，就算回到過去，現實世界也不會因此改變，就算有凶手回到過去把人殺了，也一定會被救護車及時送醫，且剛好遇見名醫師，差一點就傷到主要器官...等等的，所以人不管做什麼真的都是註定的   寫於看完電影的一星期後的邊打邊睡感想
272,yingchieh,4,喜歡男女主角的愛情，雖然不是重點哈哈哈哈哈。 讓人思考如果結果不會改變還會回到過去嗎？其中的重點還是要靠自己的努力，別做讓自己會後悔的事，亦或者可以回到過去說不敢說出的話。嗯嗯嗯嗯。
273,Hunt Chu,2.5,沒看過小說 但聽說改編幅度頗大  其實前面舖的滿不錯的 一開始的情侶篇 滿輕鬆的帶入設定 接下來的夫妻篇跟姐妹篇 則重重的一擊 頗讓人感動的 但能到未來這個設定 我真心無法理解 導致後面我都處在出戲的狀況下 再加上數回到過去那幕 一整個把她缺點放大了阿
274,許多事物的謎底都是普通的,3.5,電影的敘事方式讓人感覺像是從進場的那一刻開始，就只能被動地等待四回合的催淚彈。儘管演員們自然、深情的演技替電影加了不少分（也讓我哭了不少哈，我愛百合子），但整體來說還是缺乏一點驚喜感吧。

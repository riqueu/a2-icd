163,Alice üíú,2023/08/13,4.5,"""You should thank God the devil is a nice guy""  While the translation from the minisseries format into film form always bugged me a bit, as the first act always seemed a bit too rushed and over edited for me, can't deny it also makes for this to have literally 0 filler. Suassuna's text is some of the funniest things ever, ir has such wittiness in every line that makes even conventional conversations hilarious, and every member of the cast‚Ä¶",0.75

167,thelistislife42,2019/10/03,3.5,"7/10 A strange experience to say the least. There are so many over-the-top, silly moments that I considered giving it a 6 some of the time. But it's also so sincere, charming, and clever that I sometimes considered giving it an 8. Along with some compelling and interesting themes about religion, poverty, and what it means to be good, it ultimately won me over. A good time for sure and, though far from perfect, it's just clever, interesting, and poignant enough for me to like it.

Previously I thought it was more or less unavailable but turns out the whole thing is streaming on Vimeo in pretty good quality. I had no idea what it was about or what type of film it was, only that it doesn't always play that well to non-Brazilian audiences.

Broadly acted, shot with all the finesse of daytime television, and brimming with heavy-handed symbolism. At least it moves quickly. Picture a more rascally Abbott & Costello feature that somehow morphs into a Bible pageant constructed with cheap special effects. The humor is sophomoric, the messages muddled and pedestrian.",-2.75

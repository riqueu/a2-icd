Wes Anderson’s direction within is masterful with each section working like an utter charm, a work of art if you will. The colour, aspect ratio and dialogue are nothing short of magical and the cast within, most notably Tony Revolori, Williem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, and the outstanding Ralph Fiennes, are absolutely perfect.

80,Paul Elliott,2020/01/25,5.0,"Inspired by the writings of Austrian Stefan Zweig, The Grand Budapest Hotel is vibrantly delightful as well as ironically humorous. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, it unfolds in a series of episodic adventures involving a whole host of amusing shenanigans in a fictional war-torn European country during the 1930s. Anderson effortlessly incorporates a plethora of cinematic delights packed with moments of sharp humour, and the moments of unrest draws attention to the years of confrontation and decline of Europe’s dynasties of the era. Anderson’s signature tone is crowned beautifully with an eclectic score By Alexandre Desplat that disparages old-fashioned indulgence.",0.42

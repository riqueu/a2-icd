As touching as it is expressive, this miniseries is carried by the wind towards the chill of a slowly setting sun; an experience lifted by levity and pummeled by adolescent awkwardness.

It's a world of its own, sparkling new but faintly familiar. (Here's Christopher Lloyd, and there's Tim Curry: the cartoon antagonists of decades past.)

302,Niko Ramses,2021/10/23,4.0,"I don’t think that words will ever capture the beauty of Over the Garden Wall, a series that feels just as timeless as it is modern, and it's not like everyone hasn't raved about this series to death already, but I’ll try my best to do it justice.  The atmosphere radiates a nostalgic and familiar aura. I don’t know if that was achieved in part by casting actors like Elijah Wood, Christopher Lloyd, and John Cleese, whose voices create a…",0.69

305,The Spork Guy,2016/02/11,5.0,"""If Dreams Can't Come True, Then Why Not Pretend?""  I rarely see an animation that I'm this sad to finish. The fact that it was just a mini series spanning 10 short episodes proves just how masterful the writing of this show was. A brief chronicle of a journey through a far-off land called, ""The Unknown"" is presented in the form of a children's adventure tale. In this short epic, two young brothers traverse both physical and moral obstacles, all…",0.31
306,Ted,2022/01/30,5.0,"“Ain't that just the way...”  Over the Garden Wall is a very unique show that perfectly captures the once-a-year feeling of Halloween (or autumn in general).  Two brothers, Wirt and Greg, get lost in a magical forest and have to find their way home.  It’s such an innocent and sweet show, filled to the brim with lighthearted moments and hilarious jokes that kept me laughing hours after watching. The setting of the woods and old villages feel very cozy and…",0.31
307,Ian Kemper,2023/10/02,5.0,"Crisp autumnal fields, lamp lit forests of craggy branched trees, and cozy cabins with warm fireplace glow. Wirt and Gregory's homebound adventure can be whimsical and harrowing and a touch melancholy, with an aesthetic rich and wonderous, but simple as well. There's nothing better to set the mood for the start of the Halloween season than Over the Garden Wall.  Ian and Lailas Halloween Watchathon 2023",0.31

It’s very cute up until then but for how much praise I’d seen heaped upon it, I was expecting something more profound. Then it all clicks into place and I really understood why people rewatch this every year.   That mournful quality, the humor that at first seems to pull from that mood and later is essential to balancing out the entire story. Life and death…",0.69

I loved the animation style, and it gave me cozy autumn/winter vibes despite it being the end of summer here. The last two episodes really tugged on the heartstrings too.

I literally cannot find a single aspect about this show that I'd change. The music is spot on, special and fits the entire show so well. The opening music has these unimaginable vibes that keep the tone throughout and genuinely have an indescribable feeling when listening to it. The visuals…",0.31
